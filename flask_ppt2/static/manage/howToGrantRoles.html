    <h2>How to Grant Roles</h2>
    
    <p>
    Authentication for the PPT is done against LDAP, but we made no
    changes in LDAP for authorization to use the tool.  Instead, roles
    are stored in the acl_users object, which is an LDAPUserFolder
    object in this folder. This is a little bit different from "local
    roles," which are set on a folder. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    To grant someone an elevated role, go into the Zope management
    interface, traverse into the /mysql folder, click on the acl_users
    object, and then click on the "Users" tab.  Enter a user's last name
    in the text box and press the search button (or hit return).  You
    will get a list of all of the matching entries in LDAP.  Click on
    the Distinguished Name of the person you are looking for.  If you
    know the username you are looking for, select "uid (uid)" in the
    pulldown on the left and then enter the username.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Once you have found the right person, scroll down to "LDAP Groups
    for uid=whoever...," click the boxes next to the roles you want to
    grant, and press the "Change Groups" button. If you are doing a
    bunch of people at once, there is a search box at the bottom of the
    page in case you are in too much of a damned hurry to click on the
    "Users" tab again and wait for it to load.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    To remove someone from the list of PPT users, remove all their roles.
    Deleting the user does not work. It tries to remove the user from LDAP,
    which would be a bad thing.  The connection to LDAP is "read-only"
    however, so you can't do any harm.

    Here's how to decide what roles to grant:
    <dl>
      <dt style="font-weight: bold;">Anonymous</dt>
      <dd>If you don't grant any role, the user should be able to view the
      site without a password while at work, and can view the site from
      home after supplying their LDAP username and password.</dd><br>
      
      <dt style="font-weight: bold;">ContentProvider</dt>
      <dd>This is the role appropriate for Technology Committee members,
      mission heads, division heads, etc.  In addition to viewing the site,
      users with this role can enter comments on the projects, and edit
      their previous comments.</dd><br>
      
      <dt style="font-weight: bold;">Curator</dt>
      <dd>Users with this role have the ability to edit the metadata on
      the projects.  Right now, only a SIPE and a few other people in CPT
      management and OT have this role.  If you make someone a Curator,
      make them a ContentProvider as well.</dd><br>
      
      <dt style="font-weight: bold;">Manager</dt>
      <dd>Users with this role, like you, have the Zope "View management
      screens" and "Manage users" roles, which allows you to use the ZMI
      and to modify the acl_users object to grant roles.  Managers also
      are able to run the method that clears the table of edit log
      entries.  Be stingy with this one, but if you make someone a
      Manager, make them a Curator and a ContentProvider as well.</dd><br>
